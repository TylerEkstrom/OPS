# OPS challenges

These scripts are for OPS challenges made by me for CodeWorks classes. I made these to help learn how to write scripts. while writing these tools i have learned some of the basics of writing scripts. 

my favorite script I made would have to be the task_manager.sh script. if were to improve one script it would be ops_11.sh. i hope to improve writing functions.
